## Assignment IV in C-T-488-MAPP - Full blown app

## Discription
Ladies & Gents! After some speculation and debate we have decided that the last assignment of this course should be completely open. You should aim to do your absolute best and use the knowledge you have acquired throughout the semester and apply it accordingly. Have in mind the assignment is for up to 4 people so you should be able to distribute the workload and produce something up to standards.

 

Conditions

Any data used should not be hard coded but fetched from an endpoint
If your app requires you to share data between components, use a state management library such as redux where applicable
App should be as close to a release version as possible. Please keep this in mind when scoping your project.
 

Things to consider

If you are not sure about the scope of your idea, talk it over with us.
If no person in your group has an idea that you want to work on, talk it over with us.
If you have more than one brilliant idea, consider sharing it with the rest of the class for those who are short on ideas.
 

Official deadline is 6th of November. However if you feel like you need more time, let us know and we will try to be as flexible as possible to accommodate your needs. All within the realms of good sensibility and practicality of course.

 

Good luck!
